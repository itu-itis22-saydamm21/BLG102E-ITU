Write a C program that
• Gets a function ax^2+bx+c
• Calculates derivative on x = k
• Calculates the root iteratively
Hints
• Line : (y2-y1) = m(x2-x1)
• Use 2 close points to calculate the
  derivative ((x+e) and (x-e))
• You find the root when the error is very
  small (Root x is where y = O)
