(1) About argc and argv
• We can also pass information from command line
• int main(int argc, char* argv[]) // (int argc, char* * argv)
• argc: argumant count
• argv: argumant vector // string array
• Example:
    • gcc -o myprog myprog.c //yes gcc is also a program
    • argc: 4
    • argv[O]: gcc
    • argv[1]: -o
    • argv[2]: myprog
    • argv[3]: myprog.c

(2) Read-Write Practice
• Write a program that
    • Has a struct to get the content of the file
    • read from text file function, Reads from students_src.txt
    • write_into_binary_file Write into students_bin
    • read_from_binary_file Read from students_bin
    • write into text file Write into students_dst.txt
    • get the filenames from the command line
    • Check if you can open the file, if not terminate the program
    • Use fread, fwrite, fprintf, fscanf (alternativly sscanf)

    • Data consists: NAME, ID, 3 EXAMS, 3 HWS, LETTER GRADE
