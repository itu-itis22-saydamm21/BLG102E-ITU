        Find Body Surface Area (BSA) with Boyd Formula
•Body Surface Area (BSA) measures the total surface area of the body and is
 used to calculate drug dosages.

•BSA can be calculated with Boyd formula as follows:
    BSA(m2) = 0.0003207 x Height^0.3 x Weight ^ (0.7285 - (0.0188 x log(10)Weight))
  where Height is in cm and Weight is in grams

Write a C program that
    • Asks for height (cm) and weight (gr)
    • Calculates BSA using Boyd formula
    • Prints out the BSA
