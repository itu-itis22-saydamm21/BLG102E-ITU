Write a C program that performs the following operations on a dynamic array of structures
representing students' records:
    •Read a positive integer 'n' from the user, indicating the number of students.
    •Allocate memory dynamically for an array of 'n' student records.
    •Read the details of 'n' students from the user, including their name (string), roll number
    (integer), and marks (float).
    •Compute and display the average marks of all students.
    •Find and display the details of the student with the highest marks.
    •Free the allocated memory.
    •Your program should handle memory allocation, input validation, and proper memory
    deallocation using malloc() and free().
