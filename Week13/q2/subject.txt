Write a C program that performs the following operations on a dynamic array of
floating-point numbers:
    •Read a positive integer 'n' from the user, indicating the number of elements in
    the array.
    •Allocate memory dynamically for the array of size 'n'.
    •Read 'n' floating-point numbers from the user and store them in the array.
    •Compute and display the maximum and minimum values in the array.
    •Free the allocated memory.
    •Your program should handle memory allocation, input validation, and proper
    memory deallocation using malloc() and free().

Input:
Enter the number of elements: 4
Enter number 1: 2.3
Enter number 2: 1.9
Enter number 3: 5.6
Enter number 4: 4.2
Output:
Maximum value: 5 6
Minimum value: 1.9


Input:
Enter the number of elements: 7
Enter number 1: 1O.5
Enter number 2: 7.2
Enter number 3: 3.8
Enter number 4: 12.6
Enter number 5: 5.1
Enter number 6: 9.3
Enter number 7: 6.7
Output:
Maximum value: 12.6
Minimum value: 3.8
