Question:
Write a C program that takes a 2D character array representing a tic-tac-toe board as input and
determines the winner. The tic-tac-toe board is represented by a 3x3 character array, where
each element can be 'X', or ' The program should output the winner as 'X' or 'O', or 'Tie' if
the game is a draw. The program should also handle invalid inputs and display an appropriate
error message.

Example input/output:

Input:
OXO
OOX
XOX

Output:
Tie

Input:
XOX
OXO
XOX

Output:
X

Input:
XXO
OXX
OOO

Output:
O

Input:
XOX
XOO
XXO

Output:
X

Input:
XOX
OX
XOO

Output:
Invalid input. The board should be a 3x3 array.

Your task is to implement the program in C, considering different edge cases and validating the
input board. Good luck!
