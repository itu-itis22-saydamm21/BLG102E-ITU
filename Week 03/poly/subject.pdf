            Find Roots of a Second Degree Polynomial

• A second degree polynomial has the form:
                ax^2 + bx + c

• In order to solve it, we first need to find discriminant
                discriminant = b^2 — 4ac

• Then, the roots can be found as
                x1 = ((-b) + sqrt(discriminant) ) / (2a)
                x2 = ((-b) - sqrt(discriminant) ) / (2a)

Write a C program that
    • Asks for a, b, and c coefficients
    • Calculates discriminant and uses it to find the roots (x1 and x2)
    • Prints out the roots x1 and x2
