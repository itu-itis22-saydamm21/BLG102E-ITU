Linear Equation Solver

A linear equation can be expressed in the form:
    • f(x) = a * x + b
    • a = slope of linear equation
    • b = y-intercept of the linear equation
    • x = Point at which the function is evaluated

Write a C program that:
    • Takes in float values for a, b, and x
    • Evaluates the linear equation with slope a and y-intercept b at point x
    • Returns the value of the function at point x to the user
