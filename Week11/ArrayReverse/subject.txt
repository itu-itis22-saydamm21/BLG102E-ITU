Taxi Office
• There are N taxis in a taxi office. Each
taxi has an numeric id that varies from O to N-1.
• To be fair, they use the following strategy;
    -Taxis leave from office for costumers in a
     random order.
    -In the following day, to be fair they leave
     from office in reverse order of previous
     day.
    -This strategy continues with creating new 
     random order every other day.
